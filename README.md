# Rutgers-kun3

A complete rewrite of the Rutgers-kun Discord bot built for the Rutgers Esports Discord. Old version is hosted [here](https://github.com/sriRacha21/Rutgers-kun).

### What do I do?
Right now the bot only has a few fun commands and a "who am I" command but it is being worked on constantly to replace the old bot. It is intended to be a complete replacement for the old bot so it will end up of having many of the features of the old one.
